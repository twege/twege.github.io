# A website for my favourite character Arnoldsch Warzenegger is currently being built here!
Arnoldsch started as an action hero with Conan, the Barbarian. There he didn't talk much. In recent times he evolved to a character actor like can be seen in the Expendables Movies :-)

## Why is AS so popular?

* Watch his movies in english. It's great!
* His empathy even when playing a machine is gorgeous.
* Actions matter. Sophisticated dialogs don't.
* He never played a bad guy. 
* Can hardly remember the whole Conan movie from ancient times.
* How many people did he kill ...?
* So do like him as well!


Have nice last words to your adversaries: 
> Hasta la vista, Baby!
